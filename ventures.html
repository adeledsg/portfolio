                <h2>Context & Brief</h2>
                <p>Eddyline Ventures is a strategic business consultancy. 
                    I was hired alongside a computer science student, to <span class="highlight">lead the redesign and redevelopment </span>
                    of its website during a month placement, to bring a more modern aesthetic and increase 
                    the website’s leads via an efficient CTA.</p>

                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <p>In week one, I <span class="highlight">carried out secondary research</span> to understand my audience. 
                    I created three personas to inform the site's information architecture 
                    and user flow. In week two, I <span class="highlight">prototyped four pages </span>(Home, About, Mission and Contact) 
                    for three different media (phone, tablet and laptop) on Figma. Finally, I <span class="highlight">developed the website </span>using HTML, 
                    CSS and JavaScript over the last two weeks.</p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The new website was delivered on time and we received very positive feedback from the client. 
                    View the final result <a class="link" href="https://www.eddylineventures.com/">here</a>.</p>

                <h2>Project Retrospective</h2>
                <p>Looking back, I think one thing I could have done 
                    differently would have been to  <span class="highlight">develop the site 
                    using a CMS</span> like wordpress or webflow. 
                    I've since taken a course to learn webflow 
                    and I think it would have allowed for a 
                    smoother transition and handover to my client. </p>
